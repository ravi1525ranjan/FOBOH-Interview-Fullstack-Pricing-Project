# FOBOH-Interview-Fullstack-Pricing-Project
This repository contains a React and Node.js pricing profile feature built for a FOBOH take-home challenge. It allows suppliers to select one, many, or all products, apply fixed or percentage-based price adjustments, and preview calculated prices against the global wholesale price, with support for search, filtering, and bulk selection.
